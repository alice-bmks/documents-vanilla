# Building the Biomakespace - Get Involved!

Biomakespace is a volunteer community who are still in the process of setting up our lab - we are [open for membership](membership.md) and have plenty of roles for those who want to get more involved as a volunteer!

The links below will take you to our planning documents for various aspects of the space - feel free to peruse, join us at a meeting, get in touch and drop by our chat app if you think you can help with any of these areas!
