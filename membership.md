## Join Biomakespace!

Are you interested in getting involved in an interdisciplinary research project, meeting likeminded people, or finding out about engineering with biology?

Come join researchers, scientists, engineers and technologists at the Cambridge Biomakespace. Located in the historic Laboratory of Molecular Biology near Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, the site has three lab spaces totalling just over 50sqm where it is possible to perform wetlab experiments and a workshop area (coming soon) for rapid prototyping, electronics and dry lab work.

Created by a dedicated team of around 30 volunteers working together, the development of Biomakespace is now in its final stages.
